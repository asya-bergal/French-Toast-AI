# French Toast AI

A really dumb AI that plays the "Is it closer to Hitler or French Toast?" game with you using vector representations of words.

## Usage

You must have `gensim` installed and must download the `text8` corpus into this directory. It can be found here: http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip

More corpus/not-hardcoded corpus support coming eventually maybe.
