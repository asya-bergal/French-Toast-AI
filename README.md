# French Toast AI

A really dumb AI that plays the "Is it closer to Hitler or French Toast?" game with you using vector representations of words.

## Usage

This code is written in `Python 3`.

You must have the Python library `gensim` installed and must download the `text8` corpus into this directory. It can be found here: http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip

To play, simply run `bot.py`. First-time running will take a long time as it trains on the corpus data.

Currently hints are hard-coded enabled because it's impossible to succed without them. More corpus/not-hardcoded corpus support coming eventually maybe.
